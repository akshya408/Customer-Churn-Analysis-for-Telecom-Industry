Create a form where users input customer features and get churn predictions in real-time.

Downloadable Reports:

Provide a button to download filtered data or churn summary reports using st.download_button.

📊 Enhanced Visualizations
Heatmaps & Correlation Matrix:

Theme Customization:

Update .streamlit/config.toml to apply a custom theme (fonts, colors, background).

Progress Feedback:

Show progress with st.progress() during model training or heavy computations.

🧠 Model Improvements (Optional)
